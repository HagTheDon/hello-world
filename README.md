# hello-world
Greetings netizens,
Donald here, am a full stack web developer new to github. I intend to post code mainly helpful to newbies with little or no software engineering expertise. I have developed for several years heavily relying on copying and pasting code as my primary skill haha - don't laugh I know you've done it too. However am in a period of switching off the copy and paste and becoming a more solid full stack web dev with in-depth knowledge of every line of code I write. 
It's going to be a fun ride so follow me along - fail with me, fail again with me, and hope to one day fail gracefully.
